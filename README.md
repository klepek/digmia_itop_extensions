# digmia_itop_extensions

I have created for Digmia two extensions for ITOP

## digmia-logvol-backup
Aim of this extension is to allow defininig backup retention for storage logical volumes so that other applications using ITOP as data source can use this.

## digmia-mail-objects
Aim of this extension is to add Mail server and Mail domain into ITOP in order to have all mail domains on shared mail server under control
